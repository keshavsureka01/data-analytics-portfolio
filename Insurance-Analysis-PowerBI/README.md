- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design  
- **Power BI Service** – Publishing, scheduled refresh, Row-Level Security  
- **Python (TextBlob)** – Sentiment analysis for unstructured text  
- **Excel / CSV** – Supporting datasets  

---

## 📁 Project Files  
- `Dashboard.pbix` – Interactive Power BI report  
- `Dataset_1.csv` – Main dataset  
- `Dataset_2.xlsx` – Secondary dataset (if any)  
- `screenshots/` – Dashboard images

## 📂 Data Description  
Brief explanation of datasets used:

- **Dataset 1:**  
  - Number of records: ___  
  - Key fields: ___  
  - Description: ___  

- **Dataset 2:**  
  - Number of records: ___  
  - Key fields: ___  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Key steps performed:

- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
- Standardized data types (dates, text, numerics)  
- Removed irrelevant fields  
- Created new calculated columns (e.g., age groups, policy groups)  
- Ensured referential integrity between tables  

---

## 🧮 Data Modeling  
- Established relationships between tables  
- Built a star/galaxy schema  
- Created DAX measures for KPIs such as:  
  - Total Premium  
  - Total Claims  
  - Coverage Amount  
  - Sentiment Score (normalized)  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview  
Main visuals included:

- KPI Cards  
- Bar & Line Charts  
- Donut Charts  
- Age Group Analysis  
- Policy Category Analysis  
- WordCloud (sentiment)  
- Table with conditional formatting  

---

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Insight 1: ____  
- Insight 2: ____  
- Insight 3: ____  
- Insight 4: ____  
- Insight 5: ____  

---

## 🔐 Row-Level Security (RLS)  
Implemented RLS in Power BI to restrict data visibility:

- **Role 1:** ____  
- **Role 2:** ____  
- Users only see data relevant to their roles  
- RLS applied in both Desktop & Service  

---

## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis  
Using Python (TextBlob):

**Steps:**  
- Tokenized customer feedback  
- Calculated polarity using TextBlob  
- Normalized score using:  

```python
normalized_score = (polarity + 1) / 2
```  

- Categorized as:  
  - Excellent  
  - Good  
  - Needs Improvement  
- Visualized using WordCloud and bar charts
